\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item An almost empty structure with a command to pull from a git repo within the {\ttfamily P\+A\+C\+K\+A\+G\+E\+C\+O\+DE} file or
\item A package with the default {\ttfamily P\+A\+C\+K\+A\+G\+E\+C\+O\+DE} file and just the source files hosted within the package.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

{\ttfamily packagename-\/tbc.\+uspm} -\/ A mix between the two above, contains the source files within, but also has its install script be to compile and install the software. Very useful when there are a lot of different files and programs going everywhere or if you have a need to give the user ample time to configure certain headers or configurations beforehand.
