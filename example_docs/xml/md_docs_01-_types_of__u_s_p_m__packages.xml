<para><computeroutput>packagename.uspm</computeroutput> - This is the typical package name. It will always be precompiled binaries.</para>
<para><computeroutput>packagename-src.uspm</computeroutput> - This is a package that is grabbed from source. There are 2 general types accepted:<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>An almost empty structure with a command to pull from a git repo within the <computeroutput>PACKAGECODE</computeroutput> file or</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>A package with the default <computeroutput>PACKAGECODE</computeroutput> file and just the source files hosted within the package.</para>
</listitem></orderedlist>
</para>
<para><computeroutput>packagename-tbc.uspm</computeroutput> - A mix between the two above, contains the source files within, but also has its install script be to compile and install the software. Very useful when there are a lot of different files and programs going everywhere or if you have a need to give the user ample time to configure certain headers or configurations beforehand. </para>
